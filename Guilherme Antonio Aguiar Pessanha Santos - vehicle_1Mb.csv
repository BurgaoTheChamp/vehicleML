If you're seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm it's availability. We'll provide the local dealership name and address so that you don't waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

This car has been everything I had hoped it would be and has been my daily driver for the past 3 years. This model comes stock with 400hp and 400ft-lbs of torque and with the few small things I have done to it, it sits around 415-420 for both torque and hp. Corvette is the definition of power on demand and even when the car is your daily, the linear power curve with tons of low end torque never gets old. In terms of mileage, my daily commute varies greatly every couple months so about half of the 18,000 miles I’ve put on this car have actually been during the 6 times I’ve made the 1400 mile trip between Oklahoma and Pennsylvania. Odometer is at 50,xxx miles. Car currently has an Oklahoma plate/ title/ and registration.  This has been a southern car and has been kept as clean as humanly possible during my time of ownership. The underbody of the car is completely rust free and is in amazing condition. I purchased it in Dallas, Texas and drove it home to Norman, Oklahoma where I lived for the next couple years. I recently relocated back to the NEPA area in the fall and brought the car with me. It has the traditional Corvette removable hardtop (not a convertible) and this really adds another level of enjoyment during the hot summer months to enjoy the sunshine which are even more prevalent in the south.  In an effort to avoid the inevitable Winter precipitation, it was stored in a garage from December-Early March as I could not justify driving the car in terrible weather and risking the car getting rust with all the salt on the roads here.   New rear tires and brakes were installed 5,000 miles ago. New battery installed early last year which is warrantied until January 2022. Last year the Crankshaft pulley and seals were replaced by a Chevrolet Dealership as well. Various other maintenance items have been taken care of in the past couple weeks such as performing a rear differential oil change, new passenger window switch, new dash pillar lights among other small things included in a detailed activity log included with the car.  	I have an easily navigable binder created for all documents I possess pertaining to the car such as former warranty information, receipts, invoices and a recent activity log. The paint is in beautiful condition with minor imperfections to be expect for a car with some age.  	Pictures of the car are how the cars sits right now, but I will remove any stickers, etc. for a buyer as they desire.   It has some minor things done to it to enhance the overall appearance and driving experience. These include:  	 Fat Grip Flat Bottom Steering Wheel with Red Stitching K&N Intake Muffler Deletes ( around 50lb weight reduction) (Original Mufflers will be included with sale of car) Flowmaster 4"" Exhaust Tips C6 Z06 Spoiler 30% tint on side windows, Black Out Tint on rear window  Carbon Fiber Door Button Release Housings  Chrome Wheels (Covered with Protective Black Paint) Kenwood Excelon DPX792BH In Dash Double Din CD Receiver with Built in Bluetooth and HD Radio	   Original Sticker Price and Options list  		 -Base Corvette Coupe with 346 cu. in. 400 hp engine and six speed manual transmission: 							MSRP:                                                                                          $44,245.00 -[F55]- Magnetic Selective Ride Control					+$1,695.00 -[UE1]-	OnStar System			             				+$695.00 -[1SB Coupe] (AKA 3LT on future models) - Includes: Dual Zone Auto HVAC, Keyless access with pushbutton start, HID Head Lamps with automatic exterior lamp control, Active Handling, Sound System with CD Player and MP3 playback, Fog lamps, Rear Luggage Shade, Parcel Net, Power Hatch Release Side Air Bags, Custom Sport Adjustable Seats, Power Passenger Seat, Electrochromic Rear View, drivers side mirrors, Air Filtration - includes pollen filter heads-up display, power telescopic steering column, auto dimming mirrors (inside and outside), memory package, heated seats, premium Bose audio with six disc CD changer and HomeLink system						+$4,360  -[QX3]	Chrome Aluminum Wheels  (from ’06)	+$1,995.00 			 								     Original Sticker Price: $52,990     This beautiful Corvette has a deep growl at Idle, and a loud Bald Eagle scream under load with curb appeal sharp enough to cut glass. It will be a great addition to your garage in perfect time for the warm weather. I also have exhaust videos available to send to potential buyers. Price is $25,500, which is right in line with current market value for low mileage Corvette of this year/ model. If interested, feel free to reach out.",,pa,412.044,-759.113,2021-04-06T22:36:05-0400

If you're seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm it's availability. We'll provide the local dealership name and address so that you don't waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

Its fun to drive nature seals the deal. Source: KBB.com  * Engaging driving experience; fuel-efficient engines; roomy, comfortable seating; excellent crash test scores; sharp styling. Source: Edmunds  * Introducing a feat of engineering previously thought to be impossible: the crossover without compromise. Not only does the Mazda CX-5 offer confident driving, versatility, all-weather capability, spaciousness and advanced features, but it does so with amazing highway MPG. To make this possible Mazda developed an engineering philosophy called SKYACTIV TECHNOLOGY, including a new 2.5L SKYACTIV-G gas engine, which reimagines every component to work together in unprecedented harmony. CX-5's aerodynamic curves and sloping roofline reduce wind turbulence and allow for the vehicle's weight to be distributed toward the rear axle for increased stability. CX-5 is packed with advanced features that adjust to your driving needs, such as available rain-sensing windshield wipers, heated side mirrors, and 17 to 19 inch aluminum alloy wheels fitted with all-season tires. With CX-5's SKYACTIV-G 2.0L gasoline engine it produces 155 horsepower and an impressive 150 lb-ft torque delivering an EPA estimated 35 MPG hwy. For extra power and torque, upgrade to the 2.5L SKYACTIV-G. It's quick off the line with 184 horsepower yet still surprisingly fuel-efficient. CX-5 features two transmission options: the ultra-responsive 6-speed manual and the 6-speed Sport automatic. The Mazda CX-5 blends sophisticated details, like available double stitched premium leather trimmed seats, a power moonroof, and ample passenger and cargo volume (64.8 cubic feet) to create a stylish all-purpose cabin. Crisp, immersive sound is delivered through an available 9 speaker Bose Centerpoint Surround Sound System with AudioPilot noise compensation technology. Connect your iPod or other MP3 device with the USB audio input or auxiliary jack. CX-5 offers available HD Radio, Pandora Internet radio connectivity and SiriusXM Satellite Radio. The available fully integrated in dash navigation system powered by TomTom with a 5.8 inch full color touch screen display features intuitive voice recognition.

Rather than sit here for another few years, I'd love to see her go to somebody who wants to restore her or appreciate her vintage beauty.  The fourth generation of the F-Series was produced by Ford from 1960 to 1966. This generation has a sleeker and wider than its predecessor, the new F-Series introduced several firsts to the truck line. Along with separate flareside beds Ford introduced unibody trucks for the first time. Very few were made across 3 years, and then no more were produced, so it's quite difficult to find.  Engine: V8 292-2v 135hp 3800rpm  The truck has run fine for a number of years, but she was parked for 2 years without having been started. So now the starter motor turns and fan runs, but the engine doesn't start. The oil pan needs replaced as it leaks badly.   This is a great re-build or hobby project, depending on the truck you want.

These are exceptionally capable and versatile trucks, and it's fair to say that you're just not going to go wrong here when picking out a full-size pickup. But there might be subtle shades of ""going right,"" and at that point you'll want to look at the 2015 Ram 1500.With the only diesel engine offered in a light-duty full-size truck, this Ram can lay claim to the best EPA-estimated fuel economy in its class. But the ""EcoDiesel"" V6 is just one part of the Ram 1500's compelling story. Of course, some folks prefer a more traditional rumble under the hood, so Ram continues to offer its broad-shouldered 5.7-liter V8 as well. Even the base gasoline V6 is no slouch, delivering competitive acceleration and towing capacity for value-oriented shoppers.Besides engine choices, the Ram 1500 has the nicest interior of any full-size pickup, with quality materials and an available 8.4-inch touchscreen interface that's impressively easy to use. We're also fond of the Ram's class-exclusive coil-spring rear suspension, which yields a composed, smooth ride both on- and off-road. Noise levels are remarkably low at speed, joining forces with the supple suspension to provide a luxury-grade experience on the highway. Whether you're looking for a basic work truck, a loaded-up family vehicle or a little of both, the 2015 Ram 1500 is a satisfying solution.If you're shopping for a pickup, you'll no doubt come across the 2015 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and its more upscale twin, the GMC Sierra. They offer strong gas V6 and V8 engine options, as well as comparable cabin amenities. The 2015 Toyota Tundra boasts a strong V8 engine of its own, although it's now lagging behind in fuel economy and overall refinement. And no search for a full-size truck would be complete without the 2015 Ford F-150, which is completely redesigned for 2015 with a new lightweight aluminum body and two strong turbocharged gas engines. But even against such stiff competition, the 2015 Ram 1500 remains a top recommended pick for a light-duty full-size pickup.RECALL NOTICEThere is an open recall on this vehicle What is a recall:A safety recall involving a motor vehicle or an item of motor vehicle equipment can be independently conducted by a manufacturer or ordered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). In either case, the manufacturer must file a public report describing the safety-related defect or noncompliance with a Federal motor vehicle safety standard, the involved vehicle/equipment population, the major events that resulted in the recall determination, a description of the remedy, and a schedule for the recall. NHTSA monitors each safety recall to ensure the manufacturers provide owners safe, free, and effective remedies according to the Safety Act and Federal regulations. Manufacturers are obligated to attempt to notify owners of recalled products. For vehicles, that means manufacturers merge their own records of vehicle purchasers with current state vehicle registration information. For equipment, where state registration records do not exist, manufacturers are obligated to notify their distribution chain and known purchasers of the recalled equipment. However, even if you do not receive a notification, if your vehicle, child restraint, or other item of equipment is involved in a safety recall, the manufacturer is obligated to provide a free remedy.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved. Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.	This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?	If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.	You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?	No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.	Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?	Many customers actually take delivery without a checkbook or credit card.	While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.	Do you take trade-ins?	Yes.	We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either. We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.	What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.	This is another very common situation that usually won't prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.	Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?	We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.	We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.	So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?	COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page. Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.	I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?	Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.	About UsWe make buying and selling a pre-owned vehicle easy. Our 1Price-Pre-Owned Vehicles come with a 5-day return policy, Sirius XM  and more. Shop certified pre-owned vehicles online or in-store. Plus, wellbuy your car, no purchase necessary.
